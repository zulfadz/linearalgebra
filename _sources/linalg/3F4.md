# Problem 17: Given subspace $U \neq V$, there exists $\phi \in V^{\prime}$ such that $\phi(u) =0$ but $\phi \neq 0$

```{admonition} Problem 17
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $U \neq V.$ Prove that there exists $\phi \in V^{\prime}$ such that $\phi(u) =0$ for every $u\in U$ but  $\phi \neq 0.$

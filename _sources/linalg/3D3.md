# Problem 3: Invertible operator on $V$ exists iff linear map from its subspace is injective

```{admonition} Problem 3
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional, $U$ is a subspace of $V$, and $S \in \mathcal{L}(U,V)$. Prove there exists an invertible operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ such that $Tu=Su$ for every $u\in U$ if and only if $S$ is injective.

# Problem 19: Properties of $\Gamma(\phi) = (\phi(v_{1}, \cdots, \phi(v_{m}))$

```{admonition} Problem 19
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $v_{1},\cdots,v_{m} \in V$. Define a linear map $\Gamma: V^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^{m}$ by

$\Gamma(\phi) = (\phi(v_{1}, \cdots, \phi(v_{m})))$.

a) Prove that $v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m}$ spans $V$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is injective.

b) Prove that $v_{1}, \cdots, v_{m}$ is linearly independent if and only if $\Gamma$ is surjective.

# Problem 20: Dual basis of polynomial

```{admonition} Problem 20
Suppose $m$ is a positive integer. Show that the dual basis of the basis $1,x,\cdots, x_{m}$ of $\mathcal{P}_m(\mathbb{R})$ is $\phi_{0}, \phi_{1}, \cdots, \phi_{m}$, where $\phi_{j}(p) = \frac{p^{(j)}(0)}{j!}.$ Here $p^{(j)}$ denotes the $j^{\text{th}}$ derivative of $p$, with the understanding that the $0^{\text{th}}$ derivative of $p$ is $p$.

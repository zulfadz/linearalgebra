# Problem 26: Application of problem 22

```{admonition} Problem 26
Define $T: \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ by $T(x,y,z) = (4x +5y+6z, 7x+8y+9z).$ Suppose $\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}$ denotes the dual basis of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\Psi_{1}, \Psi_{2}, \Psi_{3}$ denotes the dual basis of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$

a) Describe the linear functionals $T^{\prime}(\phi_{1})$ and $T^{\prime}(\phi_{2}).$

b) Write $T^{\prime}(\phi_{1})$ and $T^{\prime}(\phi_{2})$ as linear combinations of $\Psi_{1}, \Psi_{2}, \Psi_{3}.$

# Problem 4: Invertible operator with special property exists iff certain conditions on null spaces are satisfied

```{admonition} Problem 4
Suppose $W$ is finite-dimensional and $T_{1}, T_{2} \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, where $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ indicates the set of linear maps from vector space $V$ to $W$. Prove that $\text{null } T_{1} = \text{null } T_{2}$ if and only if there exists an invertible operator $S \in \mathcal{L}(W)$ such that $T_{1}=ST_{2}$.

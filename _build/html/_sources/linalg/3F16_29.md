# Problem 29: Isomorphism of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ onto $\mathcal{L} (W^{\prime}, V^{\prime})$

```{admonition} Problem 29
Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional. Prove that the map that takes $T\in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$ to $T^{\prime} \in \mathcal{L} (W^{\prime}, V^{\prime})$ is an isomorphism of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ onto $\mathcal{L} (W^{\prime}, V^{\prime}).$

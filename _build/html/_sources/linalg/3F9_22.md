# Problem 22: $\Psi = \Psi(v_{1})\phi_{1} + \cdots + \Psi(v_{n})\phi_{n}$

```{admonition} Problem 22
Suppose $v_{1}, \cdots, v_{n}$ is a basis of $V$ and $\phi_{1}, \cdots, \phi_{n}$ is the corresponding dual basis of $V^{\prime}$. Suppose $\Psi \in V^{\prime}$. Prove that

$\Psi = \Psi(v_{1})\phi_{1} + \cdots + \Psi(v_{n})\phi_{n}.$

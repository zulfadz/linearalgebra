Linear Algebra Problem Book
============================================

Introduction
------- 

In around May 2021, after about 6 years graduating college and joining the corporate world, I found myself missing doing some math. I began picking up some textbooks and made it a habit of solving at least one exercise every week (often month). This book is part $1$ of the collection of problems solved by [me](https://zul.rocks/about), focusing on linear algebra. Tentatively, part $2$ will be on real analysis and part $3$ on partial differential equations.

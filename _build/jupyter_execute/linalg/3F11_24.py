# 
# ```{admonition} Problem 24
# Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix with $A \neq 0$. Prove that the rank of $A$ is $1$ if and only if there exists $(c_{1},\cdots, c_{m}) \in \mathbb{F}^{m}$ and $(d_{1},\cdots, d_{n}) \in \mathbb{F}^{n}$ such that $A_{j,k} = c_{j}d_{k}$ for every $j =1, \cdots, m$ and every $k = 1, \cdots, n$.

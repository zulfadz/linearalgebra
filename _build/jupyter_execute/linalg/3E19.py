# # Problem 12: Analogous statement from direct sum to finite sets
# 
# ```{admonition} Problem 12
# Find a correct statement analogous to Statement 3.78 of Axler (below) that is applicable to finite sets, with unions analogous to sums of subspaces and disjoint unions analogous to direct sums:
# 
# $U_{1} + \cdots + U_{m}$ is a direct sum iff $\text{dim }(U_{1} + \cdots + U_{m}) = \text{dim }U_{1} + \cdots + \text{dim }U_{m}.$

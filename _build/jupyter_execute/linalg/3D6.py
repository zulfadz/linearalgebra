# # Problem 6: Invertible operators with special properties exists iff certain conditions on null space dimensions are satisfied
# 
# ```{admonition} Problem 6
# Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T_{1}, T_{2} \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, where $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ indicates the set of linear maps from vector space $V$ to $W$. Prove that there exist invertible operators $R \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $S \in \mathcal{L}(W)$ such that $T_{1} =  ST_{2}R$ if and only if $\dim \text{null } T_{1} = \dim \text{null } T_{2}$.

    "This package uses a `prf` sphinx domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "When referencing directives in [sphinx-proof](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-proof) you need to use the ```{prf:ref}`<label>` ``` inline role.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show an example using the `{prf:algorithm}` directive.\n",
